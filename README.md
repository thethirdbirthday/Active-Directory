<h1>iPod 5th Gen Mod</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The iPod classic is a neat device that is the ideal music playback companion, even today. Here, I will be restoring a thrifted 5th generation 30gb model. The 5th generation models are recommended as they are the easiest to open and have the most third-party accessories available. The unit is functional, but can only hold a charge for 5 minutes. I will be replacing the battery with a fresh unit and upgrading the clunky 30gb HDD with a lighter 64 gb Compact Flash drive. Bid adieu to subscription services, and let's get into it!

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- iPod 5th gen 30gb 
- 650 mAh battery (those with 60gb and 80gb models can opt for a bigger battery)  
- 64 gb Compact Flash drive
- Compact Flash adapter
